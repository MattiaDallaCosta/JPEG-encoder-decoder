# Differential Comparator
 This program compares the saved image (subsampled before saving) with the incoming one and, if differences are found creates a .jpg file (named <filename>-#.jpg, where # is the number of the difference [> 0]) or, if image is completely different creates a jpg version of the compared image (without  # suffix).
